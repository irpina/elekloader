# Adding a device

Everything elekloader knows about a product is in one profile,
`elekloader/devices/<device>.py`, registered in `devices/__init__.py`
(`_all()`). The Digitakt mk1 profile is the example. The Digitone mk1's
(`digitone_mk1.py`) is a second device of the same file family, and the
Octatrack's (`octatrack.py`) a second file family; neither has linkable mods
yet.

| field | what it is | how it was found for the Digitakt mk1 |
|---|---|---|
| `releases` | each supported stock OS: its `.syx` sha256, and its main OS section's sha256 and length | hash the file, and the section depacked |
| `sysex_id` | the device byte of its OS messages | the framing messages (`0x0A`) |
| `main_section`, `main_load` | which container section is the main OS, and where it runs | the section table (id 3, `0x40000400`) |
| `stage` | where the bootloader stages the main OS before unpacking it in place | the bootstrap's loader (`0x800005fe`: read to `0x40200000`, unpack to `0x40000400`) |
| `flash_at`, `flash_limit` | where the container sits in flash and must end | the bootstrap (`0x80000` .. `0x380000`) |
| `trailer` | how the file is sealed: `None`, or `'hmac'` | mk1 has none |
| `isa` | the main CPU's instruction decoder, for the boundary checks | ColdFire (`isa/coldfire.py`) |
| `areas` | memory that is free at run time: where a mod's regions may lie | the research on what the OS never touches |
| `ddr`, `sram_code`, `fast_table` | where the linker puts mods' code and data, fast code, and the table that copies it | the areas above |
| `recovery` | how to get back to stock, shown to the user | FUNC at power-on |
| `container`, `version_len` | the file family (`'ele3'`, `'elek'`) and the version field's length | the container header |
| `protected` | main OS ranges no mod may change, with the reason | none on the mk1 |
| `blob_max` | a cap on the appended blob, if the DDR areas do not give one | none on the mk1 |
| `toolchain` | the compiler, assembler and flags the SDK uses | the CFW's build |

## The Digitone mk1 and Digitone Keys (1.43)

- **Files.** One `.syx` serves both. It is the Digitakt mk1's family (ELE3,
  the same SysEx transport and layout) with seven sections: 5, 2 (the
  bootstrap, with the startup menu), 3 (MAIN OS), 4 (the updater), 6, 7 (the
  second CPU's image, which renders the FM voices) and 8. The longer table
  moves the first section to `0xA0`; the reader and writer take that from
  the stock file. From its own main OS stream, the writer reproduces the
  stock file byte for byte.
- **Unpacking.** The bootstrap loads the updater, which reads section 3
  from flash (offset + `0x80000`) to `0x40200000` and depacks it in place to
  `0x40000400`: the Digitakt mk1's loader, instruction for instruction
  (`0x80003518` in the updater). Stock's in-place gap is 403,540 bytes.
- **Recovery.** The startup menu (FUNC at power-on) has 4 ... OS UPGRADE.
- **Checked in an emulator.** digikit's firmware check runs the file's own
  bootstrap and updater, then a cold boot and a scripted session. Stock 1.43,
  repacked by elekloader, passes it against stock: the updater accepts the
  stream, and the screens and the audio are identical.
- **Not known yet.** The free run-time areas and the hook sites a core would
  use, so only format-1 mods load.

## The Octatrack (1.40C)

- **Files.** One stock image serves the MKI and MKII. It comes as a `.syx`
  (the legacy SysEx transport) and as a `.bin` card file (ELUP: a
  word-feedback cipher with a checksum). Both carry one ELEK container,
  whose only section is the main OS, at `0x40000400`. `elek.py` rebuilds
  both stock files byte for byte from their own main OS stream.
- **Protected.** `0x400de1e0-0x400e21e0` holds the copy of the bootloader
  that the OS can re-flash. No site, blob or verified output may change it.
- **Flash.** The container sits at `0x4000` and must end below `0x200000`.
- **Not known yet.** Where the bootloader stages the image (`stage` is
  `None`), so the in-place unpack is not simulated; and the free run-time
  areas, so there is no linker layout and only format-1 mods load.

## What a new device needs besides its profile

- **Sealed files.** The Digitakt II and Digitone II seal the container with
  an HMAC-SHA256 trailer. digikit computes it (`dt2/authcode.py`).
  - `syx.write` refuses any device whose `trailer` is not `None` until that
    is ported and verified against the stock files.
  - The trailer's layout, and the preamble's length rule, must be checked
    against real files first, as the mk1's were against
    elektron-firmware-tool's output.
- **The packing format.** The loader repacks with the same codec
  (`codec/`). Check that the device's own depacker accepts it: every
  section must round-trip through `codec/elz.py`, and the in-place
  simulation must hold for the device's `stage`.
- **Another CPU.** A decoder in `isa/` with `reader()`, `decode()` and the
  flags `ILLEGAL`, `LINEF`, `FPU`, `PCREL` and the flow constants.
- **Tests.** Before anything is flashed:
  - the writer must reproduce a stock file from its own main OS stream
    (`test_writer_no_change_is_stock`);
  - a verified build must pass the device's cold boot in an emulator, if
    one exists.

Mods are made per release: a mod's target names one stock file by hash, so
supporting a new OS version means adding its release to the profile and
rebuilding the mods for it.
