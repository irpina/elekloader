"""Octatrack (MKI and MKII): a ColdFire MCF5445x (V4e, EMAC) and a DSP56721.
The main OS runs from SDRAM at 0x40000400. MKI and MKII get the same 1.40C
file.

The file family is `elek` (elek.py), older than the Digitakt's ELE3:
- one ELEK container with a single packed section, and no section table,
  content checksum or trailer;
- the legacy SysEx transport, with per-message nibble checksums and an end
  marker;
- a second transport for the CompactFlash card, the ELUP `.bin`.
Every rule was checked here against the stock 1.40C files: rebuilding them
from their own section reproduces both files byte for byte
(tests/test_octatrack.py).

Facts taken from sambanks/octabam (MIT) and not re-derived here are marked
"octabam". Where they matter, they are used cautiously:

- **The bootloader.** It lives in NOR flash at 0..0x3fff and never comes in
  an OS file. The OS carries a copy of it and can re-flash the bootloader
  from that copy ("the unit may update its bootstrap", octabam).
  - The copy sits below the DSP code at 0x400e21e0. The bootloader's own
    strings ("READY TO RECEIVE MIDI UPGRADE...", "CHKSUM ERROR",
    "DOWNGRADE NOT POSSIBLE") are at 0x400e18f1-0x400e19c9.
  - Its exact start is not known, so the whole 16 KB below 0x400e21e0 (the
    most a 0x4000-byte bootloader can be) is protected: no mod may change a
    byte of it.
- **The OS in flash.** It is programmed from 0x4000, and the OS's sector
  table spans 0x4000-0x1fffff (octabam, marked inferred there). That is the
  container budget used here.
- **Staging.** Where the bootloader unpacks from is unknown (the bootloader
  is not in the file), so the in-place unpack is not simulated. A container
  that depacks from flash into SDRAM needs no such check. If that turns out
  wrong, set `stage`.
- **No free RAM by default.** The OS gives the whole audio page arena
  (0x40a955e0-0x46025de0, 14,602 pages of 6,144 B) to samples and the
  recorders.
  - Linkable mods run with the Octatrack's core (mods/core-ot), which takes
    the arena's bottom 1,707 pages (10 MB), as octabam's platform does.
    That is 0x40a955e0-0x41495de0, the `ddr` below. The core moves the
    arena's base past them: 23 instructions carry the base and one carries
    base + 6,144, then four literals give the geometry. Those are octabam's
    arena.py writes (octabam), for the same reservation.
  - The arena clear then starts at the new base, so the OS never touches
    the reserve again (octabam, measured there).
  - A whole build (e.g. an octabam remix) brings its own loader instead, from
    right after the OS image (0x4010fdf0), as the core's `.boot` does.
- **Free space inside the image** (`image_free`): the zero runs octabam
  measured as unused and places code in (octabam, docs/contributing/
  PLACEMENT.md).
  - The 5,986-byte run is taken from 0x400d64e0, not 0x400d64da, where it
    starts. Its first six bytes follow the data at 0x400d64a0 (the MIDI
    handler vectors, then a table), and may be part of it. octabam's own
    placements there start at 0x400d64e0.
  - Two ranges that read zero are left out: 0x400d2ee6-0x400d3020 is a live
    descriptor, and everything above 0x400d8000 is the PROJECT subsystem's
    RAM (octabam).
