"""Octatrack (MKI and MKII): a ColdFire MCF5445x (V4e, EMAC) and a DSP56721.
The main OS runs from SDRAM at 0x40000400. MKI and MKII get the same 1.40C
file.

The file family is `elek` (elek.py), older than the Digitakt's ELE3:
- one ELEK container with a single packed section, and no section table,
  content checksum or trailer;
- the legacy SysEx transport, with per-message nibble checksums and an end
  marker;
- a second transport for the CompactFlash card, the ELUP `.bin`.
Every rule was checked here against the stock 1.40C files: rebuilding them
from their own section reproduces both files byte for byte
(tests/test_octatrack.py).

Facts taken from sambanks/octabam (MIT) and not re-derived here are marked
"octabam". Where they matter, they are used cautiously:

- **The bootloader.** It lives in NOR flash at 0..0x3fff and never comes in
  an OS file. The OS carries a copy of it and can re-flash the bootloader
  from that copy ("the unit may update its bootstrap", octabam).
  - The copy sits below the DSP code at 0x400e21e0. The bootloader's own
    strings ("READY TO RECEIVE MIDI UPGRADE...", "CHKSUM ERROR",
    "DOWNGRADE NOT POSSIBLE") are at 0x400e18f1-0x400e19c9.
  - Its exact start is not known, so the whole 16 KB below 0x400e21e0 (the
    most a 0x4000-byte bootloader can be) is protected: no mod may change a
    byte of it.
  - The OS's USB descriptor tables are in the top 480 bytes of that range,
    from 0x400e2000. The device descriptor there (18 bytes, idProduct
    0x0002) is reached through one operand only: `pea 0x400e2000` at
    0x4001d82c, the GET_DESCRIPTOR(DEVICE) reply, the only long in the image
    outside the range that points into those 18 bytes (tests/
    test_octatrack.py checks this against the stock file). Nothing writes
    them: the stores at 0x4001d572-0x4001d5cf set the configuration
    descriptors' endpoint sizes, from 0x400e201e on. So a mod may serve
    its own copy through that operand (`relocatable`), and the protected
    bytes stay stock. octabam's USB AUDIO OUT pokes the class bytes
    (0x400e2004) in place; converted, it serves a copy (sdk.octabam).
- **The OS in flash.** It is programmed from 0x4000, and the OS's sector
  table spans 0x4000-0x1fffff (octabam, marked inferred there). That is the
  container budget used here.
- **Staging.** Where the bootloader unpacks from is unknown (the bootloader
  is not in the file), so the in-place unpack is not simulated. A container
  that depacks from flash into SDRAM needs no such check. If that turns out
  wrong, set `stage`.
- **No free RAM by default.** The OS gives the whole audio page arena
  (0x40a955e0-0x46025de0, 14,602 pages of 6,144 B) to samples and the
  recorders.
  - Linkable mods run with the Octatrack's core (mods/core-ot), which takes
    the arena's bottom pages, as octabam's platform does: at most 1,707
    (10 MB), 0x40a955e0-0x41495de0, the `ddr` below. The core moves the
    arena's base past them: 23 instructions carry the base and one carries
    base + 6,144, then four literals give the geometry. Those are octabam's
    arena.py writes (octabam), for the same reservation.
  - From core 0.3 it takes only the pages the mods' RAM fills (`reserve`
    below: the linker computes each write from the page count n). 0.2 took
    all 1,707. octamax 2.0 took 64 on units, so the writes hold for other n.
  - The arena clear then starts at the new base, so the OS never touches
    the reserve again (octabam, measured there).
  - A whole build (e.g. an octabam remix) brings its own loader instead, from
    right after the OS image (0x4010fdf0), as the core's `.boot` does.
- **Free space inside the image** (`image_free`): the zero runs octabam
  measured as unused and places code in (octabam, docs/contributing/
  PLACEMENT.md).
  - The 5,986-byte run is taken from 0x400d64e0, not 0x400d64da, where it
    starts. Its first six bytes follow the data at 0x400d64a0 (the MIDI
    handler vectors, then a table), and may be part of it. octabam's own
    placements there start at 0x400d64e0.
  - Two ranges that read zero are left out: 0x400d2ee6-0x400d3020 is a live
    descriptor, and everything above 0x400d8000 is the PROJECT subsystem's
    RAM (octabam).
- **DSP code** (`dsp_payloads`, `dsp_areas`; elekloader/dsp.py). The main
  OS uploads two payloads to the DSP56721's two DSP56300 cores at boot:
  A (0x400e2324, 0x136cb bytes) to core 0, which runs tracks 5-8, the
  inputs, the mix and the master, and B (0x400f59ef, 0x12d05 bytes) to core
  1, tracks 1-4 (octabam, docs/firmware/DSP.md). Each is records of 24-bit
  little-endian words; both walk to their last byte (tests/
  test_octatrack.py).
  - Payload A's P memory is full, so DSP code can only take a stock
    effect's words. The one area is SPATIALIZER's code, P:0xaa8-0xbac (261
    words, from 0x400f1771), which octabam's remixes give to their DSP
    modules once SPATIALIZER is taken out (octabam). A mod frees it by
    claiming `dsp:harvest:SPATIALIZER`: it must then leave nothing in the
    OS that runs those words.
